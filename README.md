# Population dynamics with growing carrying capacity
Work with population density model

This project devoted to population dynamics with growing carrying capacity. This model describes next equation

This equation resolved thomasAlgorithm or Tridiagonal matrix algorithm, in  3 different variant for realization of carrying capacity:
* when C = constant (t_constant)
* when C = Time-dependent function (t_function)
* and case global consumption of resources, where K have description by integrall (t_integrall)
